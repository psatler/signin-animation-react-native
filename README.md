## Animations with Reanimated and Gesture Handler


```
expo init <project-name>
cd <project-name>


expo install expo-asset  (to cache, so we first load the image and then display the app)

expo install react-native-reanimated
expo install react-native-gesture-handler

yarn add react-native-svg - used for clipping the image
```
