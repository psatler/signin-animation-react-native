## Animations with Reanimated and Gesture Handler


The animation was created with React Native and was inspired in [this one](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/music-app-f97dc678-7b2d-4534-92ac-7dd0dd62944b).



#### How to run

```
expo init <project-name>
cd <project-name>


expo install expo-asset  (to cache, so we first load the image and then display the app)

expo install react-native-reanimated
expo install react-native-gesture-handler

yarn add react-native-svg - used for clipping the image
```
